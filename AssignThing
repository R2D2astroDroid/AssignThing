"Be strong enough to be gentle"
"Don't abandon what you can't replace"
"I have no enemies"
"The thing about hatred...it's the place where people who can't look sorrow in the eye without waverin' run off to"
"Good morning, and in case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night"

My dream is to one day impact others positively and create a legacy, not for my physical being, but for the work I've put in.
I wish to leave this world a better place.
Will it all be worth it, though?
Only time will tell...
